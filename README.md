## Introduction

Most NBA players that are named to an All-NBA team are also named to an All-Star team in the same year. Which NBA players are named to All-NBA _without_ being named to an All-Star team in the same year? Its rare, but maybe not as rare as you might think.

I got the idea from The Mismatch podcast. At around the 33-minute mark of [this episode](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0nFJjNqmjvdByeO2iJxa2N?si=da60ded1b41f41fd), Kevin O'Connor and Chris Vernon muse how Jalen Brunson might have the distinction of being named an All-NBA player for the 2022-2023 season despite being snubbed for All-Star selection.

Its actually happened to 58 NBA players since 1951. Its happened to 6 players exactly twice in their careers:

- Rudy Gobert (2017, 2019)
- Kevin Johnson (1989, 1992)
- John Stockton (1988, 1999)
- Hakeem Olajuwon (1991, 1999)
- DeAndre Jordan (2015, 2016)
- Carmelo Anthony (2006, 2009)
